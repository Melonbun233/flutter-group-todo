# Group Todo
This is a flutter project for learning purpose, and it's still under development.  
This application is a todo-list app that helps users record their daily tasks running on iOS platform 
(maybe we will add Android platform in the future).  
A interesting feature of this app is that people can send invitations and share lists with other
users.  

## Why

The main purpose for developing such an app is to learn Flutter, but we also hope that individual
users and small group (families) find this app useful when arranging their daily or project tasks.  

## Built With
 * [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) - Frontend Framework
 * [Restify](http://restify.com) - Backend Framework
 * [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - Data Storage

## Requirements

Here is the list of possible user tasks that we think maybe useful and interesting to be added during the early
development of this app.  
 * Users are able to choose between skipping login or logging in. If users are not logged in, all group functionalities are disabled.
 * Users can login from Google. (N/A or difficult when developing in China)
 * Users can register after skip the login, but keep the data stored.
 * Users can create new individual todo lists and group todo lists.
 * In each todo list, users can create, delete, modify, delay, complete todos.
 * Users can sort, search in todo lists.
 * Individual Todo lists have name, color, todos.
 * Individual Todos have name, description(optional), deadline (optional), repeat (optional), notification (optional), tag(optional).

Here is the list of some extra requirements that we'd like to add in the future.
 * Users can create groups to add other users.
 * One group can have multiple Group Todo lists.
 * Group Todo lists have name, color, members, todos.
 * Group member can have alias name.
 * Group Todos have name, description(optional), deadline (optional), repeat (optional), notification (optional), tag(optional), members.
